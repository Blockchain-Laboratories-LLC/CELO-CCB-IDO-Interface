The demand for verifiable carbon removal credits by brands that have made public commitments to become carbon neutral/negative.

Carbon Capture Backers are pioneers in carbon capture digital assets!

#### Summary
$CCB utility tokens will help finance carbon capture entrepreneurship and the CO2 sequestered by projects will provided $CCB holders with Carbon Removal Credits ($CRC) in exchange. 

$CCB token holders will be able to use Snapshot to vote on carbon capture startups that get to do IDOs.

Approved carbon capture projects will be able to offer IDOs on the platform based on the potential CO2 they can sequester with their project.

Based on the cost of their project divided by the tons of carbon credits offered will determine the amount of $CCB it cost per 1 ton carbon removal credit in their IDOs.

Some types of carbon removal projects cost more to perform so Carbon Capture Backers IDOs will have different yields of Carbon Removal Credits.

Using IDOs we plan to bring more liquidity for financing carbon capture projects.
